    "# Scala Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language) is JVM based and has both object-oriented and functional aspects.  Whereas Python is an older imperative language that has tried to graft in functional programming elements, Scala was built ground-up as a [functional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), with appropriate concessions for [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\n",
    "- Scala is [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), and strongly-typed functional programming languages have the nice (empirical) property that if you can get the code to compile, it will almost always work as intended.\n",
    "- Unlike many other typed programming languages, you do not have to annotate every variable because the compiler has a strong [type inference](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/127).\n",
    "- Scala is JVM so it can directly tap into existing [Java libraries](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html), and has a thriving ecosystem of its own.\n",
    "- Since Scala is JVM based, you *can* use it as a \"better Java\" and simply write Java-like code.  Don't do this.\n",
    "- The downside of Scala is that the compiler is [notoriously slow](http://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Scala-compiler-so-slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why bother to learn it?\n",
    "- Knowing more languages gives you more options (except for horrible things like [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language))\n",
    "- It's explicitly meant to be functional, so it translates well to distributed computing (where mutability gets confusing)\n",
    "- Spark is written in it (we'll cover Spark later, it's a much more modern distributed computing framework)\n",
    "- It's compiled, which comes with a slew of benefits\n",
    "- It has a REPL for testing (like Python)\n"

    "    ```\n",
    "- Here `f` is a function that eats elements (of the type contained in `list`) and spits out lists, and `flatMap` first applies `f` element-wise to the elements of `list` and then _flattens_ or _concatenates_ the resulting lists.  It is sometimes also called `concatMap`.\n",

    "    flatMap(f, list) == [ x for y in list for x in f(y) ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- `reduce(f, list[, initial])`: Here `f` is a function of _two_ variables, and folds over the list applying `f` to the \"accumulator\" and the next value in the list.  That is, it performs the following recursion\n",
    "    $$    a_{-1} = \\mathrm{initial} $$\n",
    "    $$    a_i = f(a_{i-1}, \\mathrm{list}_i) $$\n",
    "    with the final answer being $a_{\\mathrm{len}(\\mathrm{list})-1}$.  (If initial is omitted, just start with $a_0 = \\mathrm{list}_0$.)  For instance,\n",

You’re writing Scala to manipulate that data locally on your own machine. And then — and this is the really neat part — you can send Scala code into the cluster so that you can perform the exact same transformations that you performed locally on data that is still stored in the cluster. It’s difficult to express how transformative it is to do all of your data munging and analysis in a single environment, regardless of where the data itself is stored and processed. It’s the sort of thing that you have to experience for yourself to understand, and we wanted to be sure that our recipes captured some of that same magic feeling that we felt when we first started using Spark."
